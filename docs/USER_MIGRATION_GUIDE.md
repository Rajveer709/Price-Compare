# User Migration Guide: Transitioning to eBay Integration

This guide outlines the process for migrating users from the old Amazon-based system to the new eBay-based backend.

## Overview

We're transitioning our price comparison service from Amazon to eBay's platform. This migration brings several benefits:

- More reliable API access
- Better product data quality
- Improved performance and reliability
- Enhanced features and functionality

## Migration Phases

### Phase 1: Preparation (Completed)
- [x] Set up eBay API integration
- [x] Implement rate limiting and caching
- [x] Create feature flags for gradual rollout
- [x] Update database schemas

### Phase 2: Gradual Rollout (Current Phase)
- [ ] Enable eBay integration for internal testing
- [ ] Migrate a small percentage of users (5-10%)
- [ ] Monitor performance and gather feedback
- [ ] Address any issues identified

### Phase 3: Full Migration
- [ ] Migrate remaining users in batches
- [ ] Monitor system performance
- [ ] Provide support for users with issues
- [ ] Complete full transition

## What Users Can Expect
